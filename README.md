# Human activity recognition on a time series dataset

## Introduction
This repository provides source code of different models for human activity recognition as a time-series classification problem. This repository are mainly based on tutorials from Machine Learning Mastery (reference below).

## Models
- 1D Convolutional neural network (CNN).
- Long short term memory (LSTM).
- CNN + LSTM.
- ConvLSTM.

## Usage
1. Open one of the following links to find dataset.
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)
- [Machine Learning Mastery tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-model-human-activity-from-smartphone-data/)
2. Download `UCI HAR Dataset.zip`, extract and rename extracted folder as `HARDataset`.
3. Open `Jupyter notebooks` and run.
